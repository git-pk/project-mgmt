# projec management

I have created frontend using Angular and backend in Java Spring Boot

The idea is to have User and Task as separate classes.

The pattern I followed was Controller acting as entry for the REST service.

H2 database and JPA data is used here.

We could improve the performance using cached database and one mysql database.

Keeping the things granular is something I have tried, as it becomes very easy to extend.

I have wrote the algorithm for recurring sorting using rank.

Also I had another alternative in mind to calculate the rank using some mathematical operation.

I am planning to extend this projecct towards betterment as it has a lot of opportunity to improve.
